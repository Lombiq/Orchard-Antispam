## Lombiq Antispam - Registration

After enabling the feature there will be a new content type, Registration Spam Protector. An ad-hoc content item of this type will be displayed on the registration page and updated after registration; when it has a validaiton error it will prevent registration.

You can add any anti-spam content part (like JavaScriptAntiSpamPart from the Orchard.AntiSpam module) to this content type and the registration form will use it to filter out spambots.
